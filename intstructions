Descriptoin: 
This group project involves developing a Library Simulation System for a public library.
The system enables users to perform typical library operations such as borrowing books, returning books, and viewing session activity summaries.
The system also allows an administrator to view overall statistics and library performance. You are to implement a user-friendly Java program with the following features


1. Account Management:
    The program manages three predefined library accounts, each identified by:
    - ID Number
    - User Name
    - Books Currently Borrowed
    - Session Statistics

    These accounts should be pre-defined and not require any user input.

2.User Interface (Account Selection Menu):
    When the program starts:

    - Display a welcome message.

    - Show a menu prompting the user to:
        - Select a user account (display ID number and name)
        - Login as Administrator
        - Exit the program
        - If a user selects an account, they are directed to the User Operations Menu.

    - If the administrator is selected, show the Administrator Menu.

3. User Interface (Account Operations Menu):
    Once logged in, users can perform the following actions:

    View Borrowed Books Count:
    Display the number of books currently borrowed by the user.
    
    Borrow Book:
    (Simulate borrowing one book.)

        - The system charges a 0.50 credit fee per borrowed book (accumulated in statistics, not deducted from any account).
        - Users cannot borrow more than 5 books at once.

    Return Book:
    (Simulate returning one book.)

        - No fee.
        - Users cannot return if they have no books borrowed.

    View Session Summary:
    Show session-based activity summary:

        - Number of books borrowed
        - Number of books returned
        - Total fees incurred during the session

    Exit to Main Menu:
    End the session and return to the Account Selection Menu.
    The session summary is reset after each login.

4.User Interface (Administrator Menu):
    Accessible only to the administrator.
    
    Options available:

    - View Total Revenue:
      Show total fees collected from all book borrow operations across all users.

    - Most Frequent Operation:
     Show the most commonly performed user operation (borrow or return). If tied, display both.

    - Exit to Main Menu
      The admin menu remains active until the user chooses to exit.


Note (Rules and Constraints) :
- You must use only concepts covered in the course.
- Do not use arrays.
- Do not use multiple classes (this version must be implemented in a single Java class).

- Format outputs using printf, \t, or substring to ensure:
    -Two decimal places for monetary values
    -Appropriate and readable output
    
- The program must not allow borrowing more than 5 books or returning books if none are borrowed.
- If the user attempts an invalid operation (e.g., borrowing the 6th book), show an appropriate error message.
